This repository contains programs(programmed in python) for programming challenges listed for 10daysofcodevvce in HackerRank.

All the problem statements are listed in hackerrank website.

# Problem statements:

1) Left rotation program:
A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].
Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

2) Cycle program: 
A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.
Complete the function provided for you in your editor. It has one parameter: a pointer to a Node object named "head" that points to the head of a linked list. Your function must return a boolean denoting whether or not there is a cycle in the list. If there is a cycle, return true; otherwise, return false.
